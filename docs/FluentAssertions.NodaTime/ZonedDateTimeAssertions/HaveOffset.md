# ZonedDateTimeAssertions.HaveOffset method (1 of 2)

Asserts that the current ZonedDateTime has the specified Offset.

```csharp
public AndWhichConstraint<ZonedDateTimeAssertions, Offset> HaveOffset(Offset offset, 
    string because = "", params object[] becauseArgs)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| offset | The Offset that the current ZonedDateTime is expected to have. |
| because | A formatted phrase as is supported by Object[]) explaining why the assertion is needed. If the phrase does not start with the word because, it is prepended automatically. |
| becauseArgs | Zero or more objects to format using the placeholders in *because*. |

## Return Value

An AndWhichConstraint&lt;ZonedDateTimeAssertions, ZonedDateTime&gt; which can be used to assert the ZonedDateTime.

```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| timeSpan | The Offset that the current ZonedDateTime is expected to have. |
