# ZonedDateTimeAssertions.NotHaveOffset method (1 of 2)

Asserts that the current ZonedDateTime does not have the specified Offset.

```csharp
public AndConstraint<ZonedDateTimeAssertions> NotHaveOffset(Offset offset, string because = "", 
    params object[] becauseArgs)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| offset | The Offset that the current ZonedDateTime is not expected to have. |
| because | A formatted phrase as is supported by Object[]) explaining why the assertion is needed. If the phrase does not start with the word because, it is prepended automatically. |
| becauseArgs | Zero or more objects to format using the placeholders in *because*. |

## Return Value

An AndConstraint&lt;ZonedDateTimeAssertions&gt; which can be used to chain assertions.
