public AndConstraint<DurationAssertions> NotHaveTotalNanoseconds(double totalNanoseconds, 
    string because = "", params object[] becauseArgs)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| totalNanoseconds | The total number of nanoseconds that the current Duration is not expected to have. |
| because | A formatted phrase as is supported by Object[]) explaining why the assertion is needed. If the phrase does not start with the word because, it is prepended automatically. |
| becauseArgs | Zero or more objects to format using the placeholders in *because*. |
