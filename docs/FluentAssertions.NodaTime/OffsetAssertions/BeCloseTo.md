# OffsetAssertions.BeCloseTo method (1 of 2)

Asserts that this Offset is within *precision* of *other*.

```csharp
public AndConstraint<OffsetAssertions> BeCloseTo(Offset other, Offset precision, 
    string because = "", params object[] becauseArgs)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| other | The Offset to compare to. |
| precision | The maximum amount of time which the two values may differ. |
| because | A formatted phrase as is supported by Object[]) explaining why the assertion is needed. If the phrase does not start with the word because, it is prepended automatically. |
| becauseArgs | Zero or more objects to format using the placeholders in *because*. |

## Return Value

An AndConstraint&lt;OffsetAssertions&gt; which can be used to chain assertions.
